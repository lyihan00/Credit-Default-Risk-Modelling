# Credit-Default-Risk-Modelling

Analysis of credit card transactions of customers to predict whether a customer is likely to default based on their past history and background through machine learning models

Dataset was obtained from UCI repository: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients 

It contains payment information of 30,000 credit card holders obtained from a bank in Tai- wan. Each data sample is described by 23 feature attributes (columns B to X). The target feature (column Y) to be predicted is binary valued 0 (= not default) or 1 (= default).
